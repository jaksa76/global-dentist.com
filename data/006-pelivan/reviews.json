She is also highly professional and hardworking, and she prioritises her patients' needs above anything else. Every month, I flyÂ from Germany to Split for my appointments, and I have no regrets about the time, energy, and money I spend to get thereÂ because the treatment I receive from Dr. Pelivan is completely worth it. She also has a lovely clinic, whereÂ she has a wonderful assistant. I highly suggest Dr. Pelivan!"

She did an amazing job and I get compliments on my teeth all the time now! I am full of confidence. She was extremely detailed and even taught me how to properly take care of my new teeth so they last longer. Thank you Dr. Marija!"

      "comment": "After years of heavy alcohol use and smoking my teeth were gradually falling out. I had already lost all of the teeth in both the top right and bottom left of mouth so eating was very uncomfortable. My gums had also receded and it was only a matter of time before I had no teeth at all.\n\nI went to Dentists in England but they were asking for unbelievable sums of money to have the work done. A friend of mine had been to Split and she had some dental work done so she gave me Doctor Pelivans contact details and I got in touch.\n\nI sent over my dental x-rays and some photos and Marija gave me a quote which was a fraction of the cost of the quotes I had been given in England for the same work. So in September 2023 I went to Split for a week to have a preliminary examination and a few teeth out to begin the process.\n\nThen in November I went back to Split for nearly two weeks and had the procedure completed. I now have a full mouth of teeth. I can eat again and my smile looks brilliant.\n\nMarija and the rest of the crew who rebuilt my mouth were absolutely amazing. They were very careful and conscientious. I was on a time limit because I had return flights booked but Marija and the team went above and beyond to make sure I had all the work done before the deadline. Even though I had to spend a lot of time in the dentists chair I was made to feel as comfortable as could be expected under the circumstances. Marija gave me a lot of advice on how to look after my gums and my new teeth and she did everything with respect and we even found time to have a laugh amid all the tough work. I found her to very caring, very accommodating, I felt at ease in her presence and I trusted her entirely.\n\nI would highly recommend Doctor Pelivans practice especially for people from England or Ireland who may be struggling to pay the extortionate fees being charged here. Split is also an amazing city with lots to do so you can make a holiday of it while you are there.\n\nI have had my new smile for nearly 3 months now and I could not be happier with the end result and with the professional nature in which the work was carried out.\n\nThank you so much Marija."
