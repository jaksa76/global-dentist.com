Dr. Magdalena and her assistant Ana took great care of us. I wish we had this service back in the States! Highly recommend!!!"

      "comment": "Dental Centar Repic is the most generous and caring dental clinic I've ever been to. I came to them after breaking a veneer whilst travelling and they offered free consultation and free digital design of mock up veneers at an amazing price compared to what dentist cost in Australia. They did an amazing job with the veneers, Dr Dario was extremely detail oriented and did a great job at improving the shape of my veneers. They went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable, even providing me with accomodation for the duration of my dental work. And if that wasn't enough they also gifted me teeth whiting and a retainer for future use. I can't recommend this clinic enough, Thank you thank you thank you to Dr Dario, Dr Slavica, Anna and the team at Dental Centar Repic."

Not only did the clinic manage to schedule me in on short notice and complete my treatments within four days, but their pricing was also quite reasonable. They boast advanced technology surpassing that of many in the States, delivering efficient and thorough care. Moreover, the staff was exceptionally friendly, fluent in English, and overall delightful. I enthusiastically endorse this dental office!"

The inside looks nice, service is good and employees are very friendly. The clinic also has free parking upfront and the waiting time is short. All in all I'm very satisfied with the service."
