      "comment": "Absolutely fantastic experience at Klinike Dentare Duraj Dental! Dr. Julian and his team were incredible from the moment I walked in. I had a root canal and two dental implants done, and everything was handled with such care, skill, and attention to detail. I‚Äôll be coming back in three months to complete the implant process, and I genuinely feel confident and well looked after.\n\nThe clinic itself is spotless, modern, and welcoming. What really impressed me was the extra care they took - not only with me, but also with my guest, who received a complimentary deep clean and whitening! Such a thoughtful and generous gesture that really made the whole visit even more memorable.\n\nHuge thanks to Dr. Julian and the team. I left feeling reassured, well cared for, and genuinely impressed by the level of service."
