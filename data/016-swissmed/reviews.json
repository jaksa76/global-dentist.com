Starting from the receptionist well mannered, to the security personnel you will feel at home. The dentist are very professional and accurate to the minimum details, the best you can ever find. I was fortunate enough to be cared by K√ºr≈üat, very attentive, and always on the go, as well as Sedef , easy approachable Director. So I would recommend this place for the best of Healthier teeth you could ever ask for."

      "comment": "A friend recommended Swissmed Dental for the treatment I wanted. A whole mouth over-haul so to speak. From covering my mouth every time I laugh I wanted that confidence back in my mouth and my smile.  The 1st port of call after my online request was a phone from Kursat.  He was my consultant who has seen me through from my 1st phone call to the very end of my first stage.  When he asked what I would like and we discussed options available.  I had every bit of confidence that Swissmed Dental would do what it says on the tin excuse the pun. He reassured me  that all would be well and I would be taken care off.  He dispelled all of my fears and anxieties after all this is my mouth, my teeth a very important step/decisions to be made.  Transfers and hotel are part of the packageüòä.  On arriving at Swissmed I automatically felt at ease.  The layout was inviting and welcoming the artwork straight away made me feel comfortable, not that I was there for the art but the whole place had a holistic, positive safe feeling.  The hygiene levels are extremely high, the equipment is state of the art dentistry. All the staff at Swissmed made my time with them enjoyable and comfortable.  I would like to thank first of all Kursat you are a ‚≠êÔ∏è in the Swissmed camp. Also the Receptionist‚Äôs, Dr‚Äôs, Assistant‚Äôs, Dentists, General Managers, Accounts Dept, Cafe Staff, Security‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Gamze, Sevgi, Guntas, Pelin, Kepenekci, Ertan, Cetin, The 3 Elif‚Äôs, Olcay, Eda, Sanir, Dr Asli, Can and Canel  where friendly, caring, polite, patient, professional with the human touchüíê. Whoever the architecture and interior designer are they had the clients interests at the top of the list. There are several floors there 3 for dentistry, 1 hair transplants, 1 gym for clients, 1 gym for staff.  I enjoyed using the gym before and after appointments.  Even when you lie down in the chair you are looking up at a lovely piece of art to relax you and take your mind of what is happening in your mouth.  Nice touchü§öüèæ. My treatment, I had implants and extractions over the course of 2 days.  They were inserted with precision and care and I was told what was happening.  Then I had dentures made up for me which I will wear for 4 months until I get the veneers put on.  I wasn‚Äôt happy with my dentures and Swissmed (Kursat) made sure ‚úîÔ∏è I was happy and they were made to my liking.  My dents look fabulous I am so happy I look forward to my 2nd stage of treatment.  I‚Äôm not one for writing reviews but these guys run a tight ship you are valued and cared for to a high degree.  I would shout it from the roof tops.  GET YOUR TEETH DONE AT SWISSMED DENTAL THEY‚ÄôRE BRILLLLIANT.  Love you all see you soon üòÅüòò"
