      "comment": "Truly Exceptional Implant Experience in Istanbul, Turkey!\nI recently had a complete dental implant treatment in Istanbul, and I cannot speak highly enough about my experience with Dr. Cem Baysal and the entire team. From the very first consultation to the final follow-up, everything was handled with the utmost professionalism, care, and attention to detail.\nBefore I decided to have him as my doctor, I did research more than a year here in the USA and Turkey for the right dentist. Due to its excessive implant cost in the United States, I focused on four implant dentists in Turkey. After carefully reviewing their websites and their interactions with me I chose Dr Baysal without any hesitation.\nDr. Baysal is not only incredibly skilled but also genuinely caring, and he is very innovative and passionate. He took the time to explain every step of the procedure, answered all my questions with patience, and made sure I felt comfortable and confident throughout the entire process. The clinic itself was spotless, modern, and equipped with state-of-the-art technology—truly on par with (or better than) any top-tier clinic around the world.\nThe results have been life changing. My implants look and feel completely natural, and I can smile, eat, and speak with confidence again. My dentist and hygienist  here in Austin, Texas expressed great comments about my implant. If you are considering dental implants in Turkey, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Baysal. His expertise, hospitality, and commitment to patient satisfaction are truly world-class.  I am truly proud of him!   Thank you again for everything—you’ve given me more than just a new smile; you’ve given me a new sense of confidence."

      "comment": "I had a truly exceptional experience with Dr. Cem BAYSAL and her team. From the moment I walked into the clinic, I felt welcomed and at ease. Dr. Cem is not only incredibly skilled and professional, but also extremely gentle and attentive to every detail. You can genuinely tell that she cares deeply about her patients and takes pride in providing the highest standard of care. The entire process was smooth and comfortable, and I felt informed and reassured at every step.\n\nHer assistant was equally wonderful — very kind, attentive, and always checking in to make sure I was comfortable and understood everything that was going on. Their teamwork is seamless and creates such a calming and reassuring environment. It’s rare to find a clinic where both the dentist and assistant are so compassionate, detail-oriented, and committed to excellence. I can’t recommend them highly enough!"

      "comment": "I had a full-mouth prosthetic treatment with 11 implants done by Dr. Cem BAYSAL, and I can confidently say that he is one of the most talented and skilled dentists in Turkey.\nWhile crafting my prosthesis, he performed a professional shoulder preparation with incredible precision, and the results were outstanding. Before finding Dr. Cem, I had visited dozens of other dentists, and most of them told me there was no viable solution to my dental issues. But Dr. Cem not only offered a solution—he truly transformed my smile.\n\nHe uses only the highest quality materials, and although I have a very sensitive body, I have never experienced any discomfort or issues thanks to the exceptional products he uses. The implants and prosthetics have been incredibly comfortable and stable from the beginning.\n\nDr. Cem is not just experienced, but also incredibly dedicated and detail-oriented. His expertise and commitment to excellence are rare to find. I’m deeply grateful for the care I received and wouldn’t hesitate to say that he’s number one in Turkey when it comes to dental implant and prosthetic work. I highly recommend him to anyone seeking world-class dental treatment."

The entire team is incredibly professional, attentive, and detail-oriented. The quality of the materials they use is top-notch, and you can tell they truly care about providing the best possible care. I felt safe, well-informed, and in expert hands throughout the entire process. If you’re looking for a clinic that combines high-end service with genuine care, this is the place."

      "comment": "This is the first time I make a review here, just because I definitely think he deserves it to the bottom. Dear Dr. Cem is one of his kind, both professionally and personally. For as long as I know, I had a fear with the dentists (phobia to be exect) which caused me to delay my dental treatment for many years. Then at the age of 42 and many missing teeth, and many decays later I said enough and started to search for an expert. I'm from Bulgaria, changing places due to my work worldwide. When I discovered Dr. Cem, read his many good reviews, I knew he was the one. I booked a consultation, we talked and his expertise, his calming voice, excellent English and communication made me assure I was at the right place. The rest is history. I'm so glad with all the implants he did for my missing tooth and can't wait to go back for my full crowns, which you can see many excellent examples of, at his Instagram page. Another important point is, how impeccable and spotless his clinic is and he has an excellent team of assistants, especially his receptionist whom I've been always in contact with about all the appointments and everything. You have a great team Dr. Cem, coming back soon! Love you all"

      "comment": "After a lifetime of horrendous dental situations and dentists, in many countries, where i can only assume they made deals with the devil, I came to Istanbul to take one last shot at not only repairing my teeth, but to obliterate my fear and boost my self esteem.  With 3 potential  clinics in view to compare treatments,  philosophies, and costing.... Professor Cem was my first call. His consulting assessment,  personal charisma, and thoroughly paced explanations were an immediate tick in all boxes.  So much so that after leaving the assessment session, I took a stroll through the city for an hour on my way to my other planned assessments. During a brief coffee stop, an overwhelming notion hit me that I will most likely not receive such a welcome and calming influence as I had just experienced.  It was truly profound. Therefore, I made an immediate U-turn straight back to Professor Cem's clinic and wonderful team to make my commitment to go forward with my treatments.  Upon the first day of treatment, the reassurances, relaxed atmosphere, and comforting humour and banter within the entire team was incredible. Any nervous energy i carried into the clinic that day literally evaporated.  I had 3 sessions in total for phase 1 of my schedule.  Days 2 and 3 were just so easy.  End of day 3, I was a little overwhelmed by the renewed  and fearless patient I became, and all is due to Cem and his clinical team. In total, I had 2 extractions, a temporary bridge, and 8 implants. I must, in all good conscience, recommend no other clinic for such work, and I eagerly await my return to complete this positive transformation i desperately needed.  Sincere thanks and big love to you all guys from my heart ❤️."
